    <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Perform As Documented.</span> The vendor guarantees that the software will perform as described in its documentation during the warranty period on the order, except when:

                <li>using older version of the software than the latest provided under this agreement</li>

                <li>combining the software with other software or hardware in ways not described in the documentation</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Limiting Code.</span> The developer guarantees that the software it delivers will be free of code that automatically limits or disables software functionality, other than:
            <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-roman]">
                <li>code that limits or disables functionality on failure to validate license keys</li>
                <li>code that limits or disables functionality based on automatic monitoring of agreed limits on usage</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Software Dependencies.</span> If the software depends on, installs, configures, or links to other software in order to function, the vendor guarantees that those software dependencies will be either provided in the copies of the software delivered to the customer or generally available for the customer to download, free or charge, from a well known website or Internet service, such as an open source software package repository.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="italic font-medium">Liability.</span>
    <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Disclaimer.</span> Section 12 (Warranties) sets out the only warranties the vendor provides for the software. The vendor disclaims any warranties the law might otherwise imply, like warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, title, or noninfringement.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Unforeseeable Damages.</span> Neither side will be liable for breach-of-contract damages they could not have reasonably foreseen when entering into this agreement.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Liability Cap.</span> Except for Section 13(d) (Uncapped Liabilities), neither side's total liability for breach of this agreement will exceed the amount of fees the vendor received from the customer under this agreement during the twelve months before the first claim is made. This limit applies even if the side liable is advised that the other may suffer damages, and even if the customer paid no fees at all.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Uncapped Liabilities.</span> Section 13(c) (Liability Cap) does not apply to:
            <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-roman]">
                <li>the customer's obligations to pay fees</li>
                <li>the vendor's obligations to indemnify the customer</li>
                <li>liabilities the law requires to be unlimited</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="italic font-medium">Indemnities.</span> These indemnities apply as long as the customer has paid all licensing fees as required by this agreement:
    <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">General Indemnity.</span> Subject to Section 14(e) (Indemnification Process), the vendor will indemnify the customer for legal claims by others alleging that the software infringes any copyright, trademark, or trade secret right, or breaks any law.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Patent Indemnity.</span> The vendor will indemnify the customer for claims by others alleging that the software infringes a patent that vendor personnel were aware of before the allegation was made. However, the vendor will not indemnify the customer for patent infringement in these cases:
            <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-roman]">
                <li>The customer combined the software with other technology, and the software on its own would not infringe.</li>
                <li>The customer made or used changes to the software, and the unchanged software would not infringe.</li>
                <li>The customer used changes to the software specifically requested from the vendor in writing, and the unchanged software would not infringe.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Scope of Indemnity.</span> Throughout this agreement, to indemnify means to indemnify and hold the customer harmless for all liability, expenses, damages, costs, and reasonable attorney fees, as well as to defend the indemnified party.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Only Remedy.</span> Indemnification will be the only legal remedy for claims covered by indemnity.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Indemnification Process.</span> To receive indemnification under this agreement, one side or the other must give notice of any covered claim quickly, allow the other side to control investigation, defense, and settlement, and cooperate with those efforts. If they fail to give notice of any covered claim quickly, indemnification will not cover amounts that could have been defended against or mitigated if notice had been given quickly. If one side takes control of the defense and settlement of any covered claim, they will not settle that claim in any way that involves admitting fault or imposing obligations on the other side without their signed, written permission.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Repair, Replace, Refund.</span> If either side receives written notice of a claim that the software infringes any intellectual property right or breaks any law, or vendor reasonably anticipates a claim of that kind:
            <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-roman]">
                <li>The developer may provide the customer a new version of the software that no longer infringes or breaks the law. That new version will be covered by this agreement. The customer will not pay any additional fee for the new version.</li>
                <li>If the problem is infringement, the developer may get licenses for the customer so that the customer's use of the software no longer infringes.</li>
                <li>If the problem is illegality, the developer may get the approvals, licenses, or other requirements needed to abide by the law.</li>
                <li>The developer may refund any fees the customer has prepaid under this agreement for time remaining in the term of this agreement, on a proportional basis, and end this agreement immediately by giving the customer notice.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="italic font-medium">Tax.</span>
    <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Taxes on Fees.</span> The customer will pay all tax on fees under this agreement, except tax on the vendor's income.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Tax Withholding.</span> If the customer is located outside the United States and local law requires the customer to withhold taxes on fees paid under this agreement:
            <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-roman]">
                <li>The customer will make the required tax withholding payments for the vendor by deducting the right amounts from payments to the vendor and paying them to the proper tax authorities.</li>
                <li>The customer will increase the amount of each payment made under this agreement, to offset withholding, so that the vendor receives the full amount owed.</li>
                <li>The customer will give the vendor relevant official tax documentation and tax receipts showing that withholding was required and that proper withholding payment was made, as soon as possible after making any withholding payment.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><span class="italic font-medium">General Contract Terms.</span>
    <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Notices.</span> Both sides will give notice under this agreement via e-mail to the address the recipient gave with its signature, or to a different address given later for notices going forward, in the English language. If either side finds that e-mail can't be delivered to the e-mail address given, the sender will give notice by registered mail to the address on file for the recipient with the state under whose laws it is organized.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Governing Law.</span> This agreement will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the address the vendor gives with its signature.</li>

        <li><span class="italic font-medium">No UCITA.</span> As far as the law allows, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to this agreement.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Export Control.</span> The customer may not export or reexport the software or its documentation from the vendor's home country without the vendor's signed, written permission.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Dispute Resolution.</span> The parties will try to resolve any dispute related to this agreement by having an executive from each party meet, in person or by phone, to try and resolve the dispute first. Only if that fails will they bring a lawsuit.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Streamlined Litigation.</span> As far as the law allows, both sides waive their rights to trial by jury in any disputes related to this agreement. If California law applies, the vendor and customer will submit any disputes related to this agreement to a referee who will handle all issues, legal and factual. They will split the referee's fees fifty-fifty.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Enforcement.</span> Only the vendor and customer may enforce rights under this agreement.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Forum for Disputes.</span> Both sides will bring any lawsuits related to this agreement in courts in the city nearest the address the vendor gives with its signature. Both sides consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objection that they would be an inconvenient forum for a lawsuit. Each side will allow the other side to enforce judgments from those courts in other jurisdictions.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Only Terms.</span> Both sides intend the terms of this agreement, together with the order, as the final, complete, and only expression of their agreement about the software.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Unenforceable Terms.</span> If a court decides that any part of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, and that enforcing the rest of this agreement would not defeat the purpose of this agreement, then rest of this agreement will still apply.</li>
        <li><span class="italic font-medium">Excuses.</span> Neither side will be liable for any failure or delay meeting any obligation under this agreement caused by:
            <ol class="pl-4 list-[lower-roman]">
                <li>failure of the other side or its personnel to meet their obligations under this agreement</li>

Otherwise, each side needs the other side's signed, written permission to assign any right or license under this master agreement. Attempts to assign against these terms will have no legal effect.</li>
                        <li>No Delegation. Neither side may delegate any performance under this agreement. Any attempt to delegate will have no legal effect.</li>
